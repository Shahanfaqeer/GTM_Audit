    "result": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided GTM container data, focusing on potential issues, optimizations, and overall structure.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n*   **Comprehensive Tracking Setup:** This container is part of a well-structured GTM setup focused on both traditional web analytics and more advanced advertising tracking. It includes implementations for Google Analytics (UA and GA4), Google Ads (conversions and remarketing), Bing Ads, Facebook Pixel, Awin, and potentially other marketing partners.\n*   **Consent Management:** Consent management is attempted, however, the set-up is complex. This could lead to unexpected issues.\n*   **Server-Side Tracking:** Both client-side and server-side GA4 tracking are implemented. This is a good practice for improved data accuracy and user privacy.\n*   **Enhanced Ecommerce:** A comprehensive enhanced e-commerce setup is in place for both UA and GA4, covering various user actions.\n*   **Custom Templates:** The container uses several custom templates, indicating a tailored solution that might go beyond the default functionality of built-in tag types.\n*   **Paused Tags:** Several tags are paused. It's important to verify if these are intentionally disabled, or if they need to be enabled after configuration/testing.\n*   **Version 0:** The container is at version 0, indicating that this container has not been published before.\n\n**Areas for Review and Potential Issues:**\n\n1.  **Universal Analytics (UA) Tags:**\n\n    *   **End of Life:** Universal Analytics (UA) has been deprecated. Ensure that there's a migration plan to GA4, and the UA tags are appropriately managed (e.g., removed or repurposed for internal reporting).  The container includes both UA and GA4 tags for multiple events (e.g., \"EE - Transaction\", \"GA4 - Event - Purchase\").  Verify if the duplication is intentional for migration purposes or if UA tags can now be safely removed.\n    *   **DataLayer reliance** All the EEC (enhanced ecommerce) UA tags rely on the same datalayer. For example the tag \"EE Add To Cart\" triggers from event \"add\\_to\\_cart\". It seems that this event is a general Add To Cart custom event that is supposed to trigger both UA and GA4 tags, This can lead to unexpected issues.\n    *    **label variable:** Several UA event tags are set to fire using the {{label}} variable. It is unclear where this variable originates from. If the label is not set consistently, data will be inaccurate.\n\n2.  **Consent Implementation (Cookiebot, Consent Mode):**\n\n    *   **Complexity:** Consent implementation is complex with custom HTML tags to set cookies, a consent mode tag, and checks using JS variables. This setup is prone to errors and inconsistencies. Using Cookiebot's built-in integration with Google Consent Mode (as suggested by the \"CMP - Cookiebot\" tag) would simplify the configuration.\n    *   **Overlapping Mechanisms:**  The container has both \"Consent mode - Default\" and \"CMP - Cookiebot\" tags. This could lead to conflicts. Ideally, the consent management platform should handle the Consent Mode settings directly.\n    *   **Consent Cookie Settings:** Tags 92 and 96 set cookies with `SameSite=None; Secure`.  This is correct for cross-site cookie usage, *but* it's important that the site itself is served over HTTPS for these settings to be effective.  Also, the value of these cookies seems to be fixed to true. This does not account for the possibility of a user withdrawing consent.\n    *   **Consent for Bing UET:** The \"Bing UET - All Pages\" tag has `consentStatus: \"NEEDED\"` but has  `consentType: [ad_storage]`. This indicates the tag should only fire if ad storage is granted. However, the tag fires from the pageview trigger that fires on every page load. It is unclear how consent will be handled initially. There is also a HTML tag to set the default value for UET which is also suspicious.\n    *    **ad\\_storage hardcoded**: The value for 'analytics\\_storage' is hardcoded to \"granted\" for all regions in the consent mode tag (tag ID 108). Analytics storage should be set according to the user's consent, and should not be granted by default. The values for ad\\_storage are also determined by the {{Cookie - consentMarketing}} variable, meaning that if this variable is undefined, ad\\_storage will also be undefined.\n    *   **consentType** Several of the Awin and Facebook tags have `consentStatus: \"NEEDED\"` and also include `consentType: ad_storage`. In this case they should not be using the \"All pages\" trigger. Instead, a consent trigger should be configured to only fire the tags after a user has given consent for ad storage.\n\n3.  **Server-Side GA4:**\n\n    *   **Two GA4 Configurations:** There are two GA4 Configuration tags, one for the client-side (G-KNVZNWHMGQ) and another for the server-side (G-D2L00EF1V4). Make sure data isn't being double-counted and that the server-side configuration is only firing in the server container. Consider adding a naming convention to ensure there is no confusion (e.g., \"GA4 - Client-Side Configuration\"). A \"TEST\" GA4 container is also present, indicating that the server-side set-up is still in development.\n    *   **User Data:** The server-side setup relies heavily on Data Layer Variables (DLVs) for user data. Make sure that those DLVs are consistently populated, and consider data quality and hashing/PCP implementation to ensure user privacy.\n    *   **Redundant User Data**: Some server-side GA4 events pass Ecommerce data through the 'items' parameter, as expected. However, they also include the 'value' and 'currency' parameters at the event level. If this data is already contained within the items array, these top-level parameters may be redundant and should be avoided. This is also applicable to client side GA4.\n\n4.  **Awin Tag Configuration:**\n\n    *   **Multiple Awin Conversion Tags**: Multiple tags are present for Awin Conversion tracking (Awin.Conversion tag ID 198 and the Awin - Conversion Tag New Tag ID 272), and should be simplified. The new tag should be reviewed so that it captures all relevant data as a replacement for the current tag.\n    *    **Awin blocking triggers** The blocking triggers on tags 198 and 272 (Awin conversion tags) are related to advertising consent and the Awin channel cookie, and may be incorrectly configured. It is unclear why these tags would need to be blocked based on the channel cookie.\n\n5.  **Bing UET Tag:**\n\n    *   **Multiple Bing Tags**: A deprecated and a new Bing Tag are present in the container and their interaction requires review.\n    *    **New Bing Purchase Test Tag Consent**: The new Bing purchase test tag (tag ID 310) fires even if consent is not set. The `consentSettings` are configured to \"NEEDED\" which means this tag should only fire if consent is given.\n\n6.  **Data Layer Variables (DLVs):**\n\n    *   **\"eventVariable\" DLVs**: Several Data Layer Variables refer to \"eventVariable\" (e.g., `dlv - eventVariable.email`, `dlv - eventVariable.postal_code`). Standardize the naming convention for these variables for consistency,\n    *   **\"Datalayer\" variables** - variables like Datalayer.tax and Datalayer.shipping should be updated to follow datalayer v2 conventions.\n    *   **\"DlV - ecommerce - v1\"**: Consider updating this datalayer v1 variable to v2 if no old ecommerce implementations exist.\n\n7.  **Google Ads Remarketing Tags:**\n\n    *   **Triggers with FireRemarketingTag**: The \"CE - fireRemarketingTag\" Custom Event trigger is associated with several Google Ads Remarketing tags. Understand the purpose of this event and verify that it's firing appropriately.\n    *   **Ecommerce Value**: The current tag uses `DLV - ecomm_totalvalue` as the `eventValue` parameter for Google Ads remarketing tags. It is important to understand what ecomm\\_totalvalue represents and consider using the  `ee transaction revenue` variable instead.\n\n8.  **Facebook Pixel**\n\n    *   **Facebook event tracking** Facebook purchase event is being fired using both a custom HTML tag (tag ID 273) as well as a community template tag (tag ID 289). The old HTML tag should be removed and the template tag reviewed. This tag also needs a consent trigger.\n    *   **Inconsistent variable usage**: Some Facebook Pixel tags use variables that read data from DLV while others use variables that use the automatic ecommerce objects (EEC). If possible, standardise on either EEC or DLV.\n    *   **Tag TagId 70 Configuration**: The FB Pixel configuration Tag (TagId 70) does not appear to be setting the consent status correctly, so consent might not be set until a second event is sent. Consider using the Facebook Pixel (Adsmurai) template.\n\n9.  **Ternair Tracking**\n\n    *   **Double tag injection**: With the current set-up, the FP script tag (207) fires first, and the Ternair - Clicks Tracking Tag then uses a set-up tag to also load in the FP script. The FP script is therefore likely to be loaded in twice. It would be best to use a single tag to inject the script into the page, and use it as a set-up tag for the other tag.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Simplify consent management.** Replace the custom HTML tag and JS variable-based consent checks with the built-in consent integrations offered by Cookiebot (and Google Consent Mode). Ensure the consent settings are implemented correctly for all tags.\n*   **Review UA tags.** Carefully review all UA tags, confirm that their data is being captured through other tags, and remove UA tags where appropriate.\n*   **Data Layer Consistency:** Enforce a consistent data layer structure for Enhanced Ecommerce data, user data, and other key data points. This will make it easier to manage and maintain the GTM configuration.\n*   **Remove deprecated Bing UET tags** Remove bing UET tags created using HTML tags and rely entirely on the template tag. Ensure the consent parameters are set up correctly.\n*   **Verify paused tags.**  Review the paused tags to determine if they are necessary and should be re-enabled.\n*   **Review triggers.** Ensure tags are only fired on pages or events in which they are relevant, and there are no firing and blocking triggers that may contradict each other.\n\nBy addressing these points, you can improve the accuracy, efficiency, and maintainability of the GTM configuration while ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. It's always recommended to test changes thoroughly in a staging environment before publishing them to production.",

    "result": "Okay, I've reviewed the GTM container data. Here's an audit, broken down into several key areas:\n\n**I. General Observations**\n\n*   **Comprehensive Tracking:** The container appears well-equipped for tracking various user interactions, particularly in the e-commerce space. There's a good mix of Universal Analytics (UA) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) tags. Several third-party advertising platforms are also present (Facebook Pixel, Bing UET, AWIN, Partnerize, etc.). Server Side GA4 is also enabled.\n\n*   **Consent Management:** There is a good effort to incorporate consent management, which is crucial for GDPR and other privacy regulations. This includes Cookiebot integration, Consent Mode, and custom HTML for cookie handling.\n\n*   **Paused Tags:** A significant number of tags are paused, particularly related to advertising and affiliate marketing platforms (Bing UET, Partnerize, Awin, Facebook). This needs investigation to determine if these tags are deliberately paused, were used for testing, or if there's an underlying problem preventing them from running.\n\n*   **Container Version:**  It's at version 0. Seems like it's the very beginning of the development of the GTM environment.\n\n**II. Key Issues and Recommendations**\n\n*   **Universal Analytics (UA) Usage:** UA is being sunset by Google on July 1st, 2023. All UA tags need to be migrated to Google Analytics 4.\n\n    *   **Action:** Prioritize the migration of *all* UA tags to GA4. This includes event tracking, e-commerce tracking, and any custom dimensions or metrics. The provided data shows GA4 tags already exist for many UA events, so there may just be a need to update triggers and configurations.\n\n*   **Consent Implementation Needs Review:** The consent management setup is complex.\n\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   **Consolidate Consent Cookies:** The use of multiple cookie names like `consentAnalytics`, and `consentMarketing`, as well as `amcookie_allowed` cookie seems redundant. It's better to use a single, well-defined consent cookie for all marketing preferences.\n        *   **Test Cookiebot Integration:** Verify that Cookiebot is properly configured to manage all necessary cookies and that the Consent Mode tags are responding correctly to user consent choices.  The paused consent tags (default and update) may need to be re-enabled and properly configured.\n        *   **UET Consent Implementation:**  The separate HTML tag implementation for Bing UET consent control (tags 297 and 299) is likely unnecessary given the existence of Consent Mode and should be reviewed. It is also paused.\n        *   **Verify Needed Consent:** Review tags that fire based on cookie consent and ensure they need explicit consent. The `cHTML - Consent Marketing/Analytics` and the `cHTML - Check cookie consent value on allow button click` might be redundant.\n        *   **Cookie Status NOT SET**:  Most of the tags has the 'consentStatus': \"NOT_SET\" on them. It might cause troubles with consent implementation so it should be reviewed.\n        *   **Microsoft Clarity Tag:** It's requesting \"ad_storage\",\"analytics_storage\",\"functionality_storage\" which might be too wide selection of consent options to request.\n\n*   **Paused Tags Investigation:**\n\n    *   **Action:**  Review every paused tag and its associated trigger(s) to understand *why* it's paused. Determine if the tag is no longer needed, needs to be reconfigured, or is waiting on a dependency (e.g., a specific event being fired). Especially review the Bing UET tags and the Partnerize tags, as they are important for advertising and affiliate tracking, respectively.\n\n*    **GTM Event names:** Event names that starts with _events are GTM internal names, that can be changed.\n\n*   **Event Naming Consistency:**\n\n    *   **Action:** Ensure consistent naming conventions for events. For example, are \"remove from cart\" and \"removeFromCart\" referring to the same action? Standardize event names in the `dataLayer` to improve data consistency and reporting.\n\n*   **Enhanced Conversions:**\n    *     There are two GA4 configuration tags for 2 different properties: G-KNVZNWHMGQ and G-D2L00EF1V4. The server-side property is configured with `first_party_collection: true` but the client side is not. This can lead to the duplication of hits between two properties. Also there is a test property: G-K888YGNFZM which might be not necessary.\n\n*    **UET - All pages and Conversions:** Bing UET - Conversions is using same tag as  Bing UET - All Pages.\n\n**III. Specific Tag Notes**\n\n*   **UA Event Tags:**  All UA event tags seem to be using \"TRACK\\_EVENT\" and manually defining Category, Action, and Label.  Consider using the built-in \"Event\" tracking type in UA instead, which automatically populates these fields from the dataLayer. This might simplify tag maintenance.\n*   **Google Ads Conversion Tag:** The tag is using \"javascript.brutorevenue\" This suggest that the `ecommerce.purchase.actionField.revenue` already includes the shipping and taxes, therefore javascript.brutorevenue should be simplified or just \"ee transaction revenue\".\n*   **Bing UET:** There's a potential issue with the Bing UET tags. It's crucial to ensure that the `Bing UET - All Pages` tag fires on *every* page before the `Bing UET - Conversions` tag.  The use of the \"teardownTag\" feature might help, but verify it works as intended. Also, there are a number of Bing UET paused tags related to Consent. Since the Bing integration is already enabled in Consent mode, those Consent - UET tags might be not necessary.\n*   **Facebook Pixel:** Several Facebook Pixel events are paused (AddToCart, BeginCheckout, Purchase). Check the triggers for those events to make sure the pixel implementation is correct. There are currently 3 purchase events, which might lead to duplicated counts. \"FB.Purchase2.0\" name should be better defined\n*   **Retargeted.ai:** It's paused. Investigate if the retargeting campaign is ongoing, or should be deleted.\n*   **awin.journey**: Tag has `consentStatus\": \"NEEDED` but uses an all pages trigger, which is odd.\n\n**IV. Variables**\n\n*   **\"Cookie - consentMarketing\" Variable:** The regex for consent mapping is complex, consider simplifying it if possible.\n\n*    **Variable types:** There are a few javascript and Data layer variables (dlv - eventVariable.XXX) that are used to capture parameters for other tags, like the Google Ads tags or Server Side GA4 tags. Consider changing those to \"Event Data\" Variable to ensure that the data is captured when needed.\n*    **DLV ecommerce v1:** Consider if the DLV - ecommerce - v1 is necessary. If not, remove it.\n\n**V. Triggers**\n\n*   **\"Blocking - Advertising consent is not true\" Trigger:** Ensure this trigger is correctly blocking the tags that require marketing consent.\n*   **Remarketing Triggers:** There is a few remarketing triggers related to firing the tags, but they all seems to be a catch-all. It would be preferable to use a custom event specific for each event (add_to_cart, view_item etc)\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis is a relatively mature GTM container with a good foundation. However, the imminent UA sunset, the complexity of the consent management, and the presence of numerous paused tags indicate a need for a thorough review and optimization.\n",
