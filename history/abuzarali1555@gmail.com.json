    "result": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided GTM container data, focusing on potential issues, best practices, and areas for improvement. This analysis is based on the data alone, so there may be external factors influencing certain decisions that I'm unaware of.\n\n**General Observations**\n\n*   **Comprehensive Tracking:** The container indicates a fairly comprehensive tracking setup for a web property (\"www.welhof.com\"), spanning various marketing and analytics platforms (Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Universal Analytics (UA), Google Ads, Bing Ads, Facebook Pixel, Awin, Ternair, Retargeted.ai, Microsoft Clarity,  Partnerize).\n*   **Consent Management:** Consent management is partially implemented with Cookiebot, including cookie-setting tags and some consent mode. This is good, but there are some potential pitfalls that I'll highlight below.\n*   **Server-Side Tagging:**  Server-side tagging is present using GA4. This is a good approach to improve data privacy and website performance.\n*   **Paused Tags:** Many tags are paused. This indicates work in progress, testing, or obsolete configurations. It's important to review these paused tags to determine if they should be removed or re-activated.\n*   **Deprecated Technology:** The reliance on UA (Universal Analytics) is a concern as it is no longer processing new data. The presence of both UA and GA4 tracking suggests that the website is still in the process of migrating away from UA.\n\n**Key Areas of Concern and Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Universal Analytics (UA) Migration:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** UA will no longer process new data. Continuing to send data to UA is not useful and adds unnecessary complexity.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Prioritize completing the GA4 migration.\n        *   Ensure *all* key metrics are being tracked accurately in GA4.\n        *   Remove all UA tags (`ua` type tags) *once* you are confident with GA4.\n        *   Ensure the `Universal Analytics - purchase` tag is removed which is blocked by the purchase trigger but it also appears that this tag is fired by DOM ready - Purchase.\n\n2.  **Paused Tags - Review and Clean Up:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Numerous tags are paused (Bing UET - All Pages, Bing UET - Conversions, Consent mode - Default, Consent mode - Update ad storage settings, Partnerize tags, Retargeted.ai, cHTML - NoCookieBotBranding, FB event tags).  Paused tags clutter the container and can introduce confusion.\n    *   **Recommendation:**\n        *   **Audit:** Review *each* paused tag.  Ask:\n            *   Is this tag still needed?\n            *   Is it for a campaign that ended?\n            *   Is it a duplicate of an active tag?\n            *   Is it partially configured?\n        *   **Action:**\n            *   If the tag is no longer needed, *remove it*. This simplifies the container.\n            *   If the tag *is* needed, finish the configuration, test it thoroughly, and activate it. Consider using workspaces to manage this process.\n            *   If the tag is under consideration, create a comment indicating its status.\n\n3.  **Bing UET Implementation and Consent:**\n\n    *   **Issue:**  The Bing UET tag setup appears incomplete or confusing:\n        *   The `Bing UET - All Pages` tag is paused.\n        *   There are separate tags for \"All Pages\" and \"Conversions,\" and they both seem to contain the same core UET script in their HTML. This is redundant.\n        *   The `Bing UET - All Pages` tag is paused and has \"NEEDED\" consent, but there is no firing trigger for the update. This might be a problem. There's also a paused `HTML - UET - Update` tag to address this.\n    *   **Recommendation:**\n        *   **Consolidate:** Combine the UET tracking into *one* base tag for all pages.\n        *   **UET V2 tags:** The tag setup uses the custom HTML tag type but there is also the UET tag built in within GTM now. Consolidating using the UET v2 template tag allows Google Tag Manager to automatically handle consent updates.\n        *    **Review firing trigger for consent:** The `HTML - Consent - UET` seems to set default consent, but is paused. Ensure that any consent-dependent UET configurations respect the consent choices using appropriate triggers and variables.\n        *    **Remove redundant update:** Verify and remove the update tag.\n\n4.  **Consent Status and Cookie-Setting Tags:**\n\n    *   **Issue:**  The consent management setup relies on Custom HTML tags to set \"consentAnalytics\" and \"consentMarketing\" cookies based on custom events (`cHTML - Consent Analytics`, `cHTML - Consent Marketing`).  This is a *very fragile* and outdated approach.  These cHTML cookie tags also set first-party cookies with cross-site tracking.\n        *   This cookie setting is occurring before consent.\n        *   The `consentAnalytics` and `consentMarketing` values do not seem to be mapped as analytics and marketing.\n        *   These tags are associated with triggers that directly respond to the button clicks of the consent banner instead of responding to the event after processing. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Recommendation:**\n        *   **Use Cookiebot's GTM Integration (CMP - Cookiebot tag):** If using Cookiebot, *use their official GTM integration*. Cookiebot has a built-in GTM template specifically designed to handle default consent settings and consent updates from the banner.\n        *   **Proper Consent Integration:** Implement proper consent triggers and built-in variables based on *actual* consent values from Cookiebot (or whatever CMP is used). If using the Cookiebot built-in template, you probably won't need the `Event - Cookies accepted` trigger, or the `cHTML - Check cookie consent value on allow button click` tag, the `UA - Event - Cookies accepted` tag and `GA4 - Event - Cookies accepted` tag.\n\n5.  **Partnerize, Awin and Ternair:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Three different affiliate tags.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Evaluate all three of these tags and determine if all are needed. Implement only the needed ones and if there are any needed then confirm they are all capturing correct data from the same data layers,\n\n6.  **Google Ads Remarketing Tags:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Three remarketing tags for Google Ads: View Item, AddToCart and Checkout. All have similar codes and configurations.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Consolidate into a single remarketing tag, if they can be configured within one. This makes it easier to manage.\n\n7.  **Ternair Implementation:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** The Ternair implementation uses a \"clicks tracking\" tag that appears to be pushing data into a cookie. Then the clicks tracking tag is connected as a setup tag to the FP script.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Review the FP script and setup tag to confirm if clicks are indeed being sent to Ternair and the right data is being captured. This setup seems non-standard.\n\n8.  **Server-Side GA4 Configuration:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Two GA4 server-side configuration tags with different tag IDs G-D2L00EF1V4 for production and G-K888YGNFZM for testing). It is unclear if both are needed or if this is intended to serve as a testing process.\n    *   **Recommendation:** If the test tag has been implemented for testing, then consider removing it after.\n\n**Other Considerations**\n\n*   **Naming Conventions:** Enforce consistent naming conventions for triggers, tags, and variables to improve readability and maintainability.\n*   **Data Layer Strategy:**  Ensure a well-defined data layer strategy is in place to standardize data capture.  This will simplify tag configuration and ensure data accuracy.  Review the data layer variables; are they all still relevant? Consider adding better descriptions to each data layer variable.\n*   **Testing and Debugging:** Implement a rigorous testing process, ideally with a dedicated testing environment. Regularly use GTM's Preview mode to verify tag behavior.\n\n**Tools to Aid the Audit**\n\n*   **GTM Sonar:** A Chrome extension to get a better picture of variables, triggers, and tags that is easier to view.\n*   **Data Layer Inspector +:** Chrome extension to view and debug data layer pushes.\n*   **Google Tag Assistant Legacy:** This tool can help debug which tags are firing on which pages.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you can improve the performance, accuracy, and maintainability of the GTM container for \"www.welhof.com.\" Make sure to thoroughly test any changes before publishing them to the live site!",
