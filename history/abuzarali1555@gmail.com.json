    "result": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided GTM container data, focusing on potential issues, best practices, and areas for improvement. This analysis is based on the data alone, so there may be external factors influencing certain decisions that I'm unaware of.\n\n**General Observations**\n\n*   **Comprehensive Tracking:** The container indicates a fairly comprehensive tracking setup for a web property (\"www.welhof.com\"), spanning various marketing and analytics platforms (Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Universal Analytics (UA), Google Ads, Bing Ads, Facebook Pixel, Awin, Ternair, Retargeted.ai, Microsoft Clarity,  Partnerize).\n*   **Consent Management:** Consent management is partially implemented with Cookiebot, including cookie-setting tags and some consent mode. This is good, but there are some potential pitfalls that I'll highlight below.\n*   **Server-Side Tagging:**  Server-side tagging is present using GA4. This is a good approach to improve data privacy and website performance.\n*   **Paused Tags:** Many tags are paused. This indicates work in progress, testing, or obsolete configurations. It's important to review these paused tags to determine if they should be removed or re-activated.\n*   **Deprecated Technology:** The reliance on UA (Universal Analytics) is a concern as it is no longer processing new data. The presence of both UA and GA4 tracking suggests that the website is still in the process of migrating away from UA.\n\n**Key Areas of Concern and Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Universal Analytics (UA) Migration:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** UA will no longer process new data. Continuing to send data to UA is not useful and adds unnecessary complexity.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Prioritize completing the GA4 migration.\n        *   Ensure *all* key metrics are being tracked accurately in GA4.\n        *   Remove all UA tags (`ua` type tags) *once* you are confident with GA4.\n        *   Ensure the `Universal Analytics - purchase` tag is removed which is blocked by the purchase trigger but it also appears that this tag is fired by DOM ready - Purchase.\n\n2.  **Paused Tags - Review and Clean Up:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Numerous tags are paused (Bing UET - All Pages, Bing UET - Conversions, Consent mode - Default, Consent mode - Update ad storage settings, Partnerize tags, Retargeted.ai, cHTML - NoCookieBotBranding, FB event tags).  Paused tags clutter the container and can introduce confusion.\n    *   **Recommendation:**\n        *   **Audit:** Review *each* paused tag.  Ask:\n            *   Is this tag still needed?\n            *   Is it for a campaign that ended?\n            *   Is it a duplicate of an active tag?\n            *   Is it partially configured?\n        *   **Action:**\n            *   If the tag is no longer needed, *remove it*. This simplifies the container.\n            *   If the tag *is* needed, finish the configuration, test it thoroughly, and activate it. Consider using workspaces to manage this process.\n            *   If the tag is under consideration, create a comment indicating its status.\n\n3.  **Bing UET Implementation and Consent:**\n\n    *   **Issue:**  The Bing UET tag setup appears incomplete or confusing:\n        *   The `Bing UET - All Pages` tag is paused.\n        *   There are separate tags for \"All Pages\" and \"Conversions,\" and they both seem to contain the same core UET script in their HTML. This is redundant.\n        *   The `Bing UET - All Pages` tag is paused and has \"NEEDED\" consent, but there is no firing trigger for the update. This might be a problem. There's also a paused `HTML - UET - Update` tag to address this.\n    *   **Recommendation:**\n        *   **Consolidate:** Combine the UET tracking into *one* base tag for all pages.\n        *   **UET V2 tags:** The tag setup uses the custom HTML tag type but there is also the UET tag built in within GTM now. Consolidating using the UET v2 template tag allows Google Tag Manager to automatically handle consent updates.\n        *    **Review firing trigger for consent:** The `HTML - Consent - UET` seems to set default consent, but is paused. Ensure that any consent-dependent UET configurations respect the consent choices using appropriate triggers and variables.\n        *    **Remove redundant update:** Verify and remove the update tag.\n\n4.  **Consent Status and Cookie-Setting Tags:**\n\n    *   **Issue:**  The consent management setup relies on Custom HTML tags to set \"consentAnalytics\" and \"consentMarketing\" cookies based on custom events (`cHTML - Consent Analytics`, `cHTML - Consent Marketing`).  This is a *very fragile* and outdated approach.  These cHTML cookie tags also set first-party cookies with cross-site tracking.\n        *   This cookie setting is occurring before consent.\n        *   The `consentAnalytics` and `consentMarketing` values do not seem to be mapped as analytics and marketing.\n        *   These tags are associated with triggers that directly respond to the button clicks of the consent banner instead of responding to the event after processing. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Recommendation:**\n        *   **Use Cookiebot's GTM Integration (CMP - Cookiebot tag):** If using Cookiebot, *use their official GTM integration*. Cookiebot has a built-in GTM template specifically designed to handle default consent settings and consent updates from the banner.\n        *   **Proper Consent Integration:** Implement proper consent triggers and built-in variables based on *actual* consent values from Cookiebot (or whatever CMP is used). If using the Cookiebot built-in template, you probably won't need the `Event - Cookies accepted` trigger, or the `cHTML - Check cookie consent value on allow button click` tag, the `UA - Event - Cookies accepted` tag and `GA4 - Event - Cookies accepted` tag.\n\n5.  **Partnerize, Awin and Ternair:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Three different affiliate tags.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Evaluate all three of these tags and determine if all are needed. Implement only the needed ones and if there are any needed then confirm they are all capturing correct data from the same data layers,\n\n6.  **Google Ads Remarketing Tags:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Three remarketing tags for Google Ads: View Item, AddToCart and Checkout. All have similar codes and configurations.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Consolidate into a single remarketing tag, if they can be configured within one. This makes it easier to manage.\n\n7.  **Ternair Implementation:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** The Ternair implementation uses a \"clicks tracking\" tag that appears to be pushing data into a cookie. Then the clicks tracking tag is connected as a setup tag to the FP script.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Review the FP script and setup tag to confirm if clicks are indeed being sent to Ternair and the right data is being captured. This setup seems non-standard.\n\n8.  **Server-Side GA4 Configuration:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Two GA4 server-side configuration tags with different tag IDs G-D2L00EF1V4 for production and G-K888YGNFZM for testing). It is unclear if both are needed or if this is intended to serve as a testing process.\n    *   **Recommendation:** If the test tag has been implemented for testing, then consider removing it after.\n\n**Other Considerations**\n\n*   **Naming Conventions:** Enforce consistent naming conventions for triggers, tags, and variables to improve readability and maintainability.\n*   **Data Layer Strategy:**  Ensure a well-defined data layer strategy is in place to standardize data capture.  This will simplify tag configuration and ensure data accuracy.  Review the data layer variables; are they all still relevant? Consider adding better descriptions to each data layer variable.\n*   **Testing and Debugging:** Implement a rigorous testing process, ideally with a dedicated testing environment. Regularly use GTM's Preview mode to verify tag behavior.\n\n**Tools to Aid the Audit**\n\n*   **GTM Sonar:** A Chrome extension to get a better picture of variables, triggers, and tags that is easier to view.\n*   **Data Layer Inspector +:** Chrome extension to view and debug data layer pushes.\n*   **Google Tag Assistant Legacy:** This tool can help debug which tags are firing on which pages.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you can improve the performance, accuracy, and maintainability of the GTM container for \"www.welhof.com.\" Make sure to thoroughly test any changes before publishing them to the live site!",

    "result": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided Google Tag Manager (GTM) container, focusing on potential issues and areas for improvement:\n\n**General Overview**\n\n*   **Container Type:** This GTM container is for a website (\"www.welhof.com\").\n*   **Version:** The container version ID is 0.  This suggests this is either a very new or reset container.\n*   **Features Enabled:** It uses User Permissions, Environments, Workspaces, Built-in Variables, Folders, Tags, Templates, Triggers, Variables, and Versions. It *doesn't* use Gtag Configs, Clients, Transformations, or Zones. This configuration is typical for a standard website setup with relatively modern GTM practices.\n*   **Tag Count:** The container has a significant number of tags (around 40), suggesting a mature tracking setup.\n*   **Platform Variety:**  It includes tags for Google Analytics (Universal Analytics and GA4), Google Ads (Remarketing and Conversions), Bing UET, Facebook Pixel, Awin, Partnerize, Ternair, Retargeted.ai, microsoft-clarity and Wiqhit.\n\n**Key Areas of Concern and Recommendations**\n\n1.  **Universal Analytics (UA) Usage:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Several tags (e.g., \"EE Remove From Cart\", \"EE Add To Compare\", \"Universal Analytics\", etc.) are using the \"ua\" tag type, which corresponds to Universal Analytics.  Google sunsetted Universal Analytics on July 1, 2023. These tags will no longer send data.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Migrate *all* Universal Analytics tags to Google Analytics 4 (GA4).  Consider deleting or pausing the UA tags after migration is complete and verified.  The GA4 implementation appears to be present, but confirming data alignment with UA will be necessary.\n\n2.  **Consent Management and Compliance:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** The container includes a mix of custom HTML tags for setting consent cookies (`cHTML - Consent Analytics`, `cHTML - Consent Marketing`) and a Cookiebot integration. There also paused Consent mode related default and update tags. There is a test version of GA4 server side configuration and a couple of UET consent mode tags.\n    *   **Recommendation:**\n        *  Enable cookiebot, and remove homebrew solution for setting cookies. Use cookiebot integration tag (Tag ID 286).\n        *  Make sure that all consent relevant tags are correctly triggered, unpaused and test.\n        *  It's important to confirm compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations relevant to the website's audience.\n        *  Ensure there's a clear and user-friendly consent banner/mechanism in place.\n        *  Tags like Facebook Pixel and Bing UET *require* explicit user consent before firing. The current implementation seems to set the same consent requirements for Analytics.\n\n3.  **Bing UET Implementation:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Two `html` type tags (\"Bing UET - All Pages\", \"Bing UET - Conversions\") are paused. The 'Bing UET - All Pages' have a consent status 'NEEDED'. The consent check for that Bing UET implementation is also incomplete and/or inconsistent.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Use the pre-built Bing UET tag template in GTM instead of custom HTML for better maintainability and more straightforward consent integration and unpaused the 'Bing UET - Tag - New Test', 'HTML - UET - Update', 'HTML - Consent - UET'.\n\n4.  **A/B testing setup:**\n    *   **Issue:** Seems like partnerize, retargeted ai and awin implementations are paused.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Consider remove or test/implement.\n\n5.  **Server-Side Tagging:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** The container has server-side GA4 configuration and event tags, along with a `server_container_url` parameter set.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Confirm the server-side container is correctly set up and data is being properly sent from the website to the server container. Test data quality and accuracy. Make sure that server side and client side configuration for GA4 is consistent. For example there is a 'test' property being sent into the custom parameters table to the test GA4 config, but the actual GA4 implementation is not tested.\n\n6.  **Google Ads Remarketing:**\n    *   **Issue:** There are multiple google ads remarketing tags for add to cart, checkout, view_item, purchase. They are all active using the SP type.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Check this. SP tag type should only be used to get additional value to Google via User provided data.\n\n7.  **GA4 Configuration Tag:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** The GA4 Configuration tag (Tag ID 124) has parameters `allow_ad_personalization_signals` and `allow_google_signals` that depend on variable `{{JS - Advertising cookies accepted}}`.\n    *   **Recommendation:** This is good for consent management, but it's crucial to ensure this variable accurately reflects the user's consent choices regarding advertising cookies. Confirm this is actually working with the cookie banner that is implemented.\n8.  **Data Layer Variables:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** There are many variables defined that read values from the data layer.  Some of them have vague names (e.g., \"label\", \"visitor\", \"performance\"), or not.\n    *   **Recommendation:**\n        *   Document *every* data layer variable and what its purpose is.\n        *   Use clear, descriptive names that are easy to understand and consistent. For example, instead of \"label\", use \"eventName\" or \"addToCartLabel\".\n\n9.  **Use consistent currency parameter values:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Multiple tags are using different currency codes with different cases (eg. \"EUR\", \"{{ee transaction currency}}\").\n    *   **Recommendation:** Pick one value that is consistent between all tags using that parameter.\n\n10. **Multiple AWIN implementations:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** The container seems to have two different Awin implementations\n    *   **Recommendation:** Verify if this is the case and stick with only one.\n\n11. **Unpaused default UET consent setup:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** The name of the tag 'HTML - Consent - UET' suggests that its purpose is to 'default' the consent, and is unpaused.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Remove the tag since it is using hardcoded javascript and its value is questionable.\n\n12. **HTML tag 'cHTML - Check cookie consent value on allow button click'**\n    *   **Issue:** This tag is running JS code to access the cookie and pushing dataLayer event\n    *   **Recommendation:** Remove this tag and use the cookiebot or similar cookie manager to push the event properly.\n\n13. **Test UA config:**\n    *   **Issue:** The UA has a dimension setup for Advertising cookies accepted, but the 'view_item_out_of_stock' is sending information in dimension10.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Remove UA dimension, fix 'view_item_out_of_stock' dimension10 information, or test and understand that that implementation has the correct values.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n*   **Triggers:** Examine all triggers to ensure they are firing at the correct times and on the correct pages.  Pay attention to the blocking triggers (Tag ID 50).\n*   **Tag Sequencing:**  The \"setupTag\" and \"teardownTag\" features can be useful but require careful consideration. Make sure that set-up tags fire *before* the primary tag, and teardown tags fire *after*.\n*   **Tag Firing Options:**  Check \"ONCE_PER_PAGE\", \"ONCE_PER_EVENT\", and \"ONCE_PER_LOAD\" settings.  In some cases, \"ONCE_PER_EVENT\" may be more appropriate for event-based tracking. The bing 'All Pages' should not be ONCE_PER_EVENT.\n\n**How to Perform the Audit**\n\n1.  **Walkthrough:**  Manually review *every* tag, trigger, and variable in the GTM container using the GTM interface.\n2.  **Debugging:**  Use GTM's preview and debug mode to test the firing of tags and the accuracy of variable values.\n3.  **Data Validation:** After making changes, closely monitor data in Google Analytics, Google Ads, and other platforms to verify the tracking is working correctly.\n4.  **Documentation:** Create and maintain clear documentation of every tag, trigger, and variable to aid in future maintenance and troubleshooting.\n\nBy addressing these issues and implementing these recommendations, you can significantly improve the accuracy, efficiency, and compliance of your GTM tracking setup.",
