    "result": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided Google Tag Manager container data, focusing on potential issues, areas for improvement, and general observations.\n\n**General Overview**\n\n*   **Container Setup:** The container uses workspaces, environments, and folders, which is good practice for organization and control. It also supports user permissions, built-in variables, tags, triggers, and variables, so the basics are in order.\n*   **Account and Container Information:** Includes account ID, container ID, container name (\"www.welhof.com\"), and public ID.\n*   **Tags Present:** The container has a good variety of tags from Google Analytics (UA and GA4, both client-side and server-side), Google Ads (conversions and remarketing), Bing UET, Facebook Pixel, and various third-party tools for affiliate marketing (Awin, Partnerize), retargeting (Retargeted.ai), and more specific analytics (Ternair, Wiqhit, Microsoft Clarity).\n*   **Consent Management:** Appears to be using a custom Cookie consent and implementing Google Consent Mode. This is crucial for privacy compliance (GDPR, etc.).\n*   **Server-Side Tagging:** There's a GA4 server-side configuration, indicating an attempt to improve data accuracy and privacy.\n\n**Potential Issues and Areas for Improvement**\n\n1.  **UA (Universal Analytics) is being deprecated by Google**\n\n    *   **Problem:** As of July 1, 2023, Universal Analytics stopped processing new hits.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure that GA4 is the primary analytics platform. UA tags should be phased out completely, and ideally, all UA-specific variables and triggers can be removed to clean up the container.\n    *   **In this container:** It appears UA tags exist alongside GA4 ones, suggesting a migration period. Be sure the migration is complete.\n\n2.  **Paused Tags:**\n\n    *   **Problem:** Several tags are paused (e.g., \"Bing UET - All Pages,\" \"Partnerize - Click Reference,\" \"Consent mode - Default\").\n    *   **Recommendation:** Review *why* these tags are paused.  Are they no longer needed?  If so, remove them. If they *are* needed, but paused for a specific reason (e.g., testing, waiting for a campaign to start), document that reason and set a reminder to re-enable them when appropriate.  Keeping paused, unused tags clutters the container.\n\n3.  **Bing UET Setup**\n\n    *   **Problem:** Two separate HTML tags (Bing UET - All Pages and Bing UET - Conversions). Consider using the official UET tag instead.\n\n    *   **Problem:** Bing UET tag needs storage consent\n\n    *   **Recommendation:** Replace with the new Microsoft (Bing) UET tag type.  This streamlines the setup and might offer better features and support.\n\n4.  **Consent Configuration Inconsistencies**\n\n    *   **Problem:** Conflicting consent setups - using cookie-setting HTML tags AND Consent Mode tags.\n    *   **Recommendation:** This is a high-priority issue. Using multiple consent mechanisms can lead to tags firing incorrectly or conflicting cookie values. Consolidate to a single consent management system.  It seems like Cookiebot is intended.\n    *   Disable the \"cHTML - Consent Analytics\" and \"cHTML - Consent Marketing\" HTML tags that set cookies manually.\n    *   Remove the \"cHTML - Check cookie consent value on allow button click\" custom HTML tag. Its purpose is redundant with a well-configured CMP.\n    *   Remove the custom Consent Mode Default and Update tags and leverage the \"CMP - Cookiebot\" custom template to manage consent.\n    *   **Make sure consent is properly integrated and tested before going live.**\n\n5.  **Cookie Setting Using HTML Tags:**\n\n    *   **Problem:** The container uses custom HTML tags (\"cHTML - Consent Analytics\", \"cHTML - Consent Marketing\") to set cookies related to consent.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Cookie setting should be done by a dedicated Consent Management Platform (CMP), such as Cookiebot. It provides a more robust and reliable mechanism for managing user consent and complying with regulations.  These custom HTML tags might be redundant or conflict with other consent mechanisms.\n\n6.  **Cookiebot setup**\n\n    *   **Problem:** The \"CMP - Cookiebot\" custom template is paused\n\n    *   **Problem:** The name of the custom-templated Cookiebot tag, `CMP - Cookiebot`, does not appear as an element to set up in the default consent mode template, `Consent mode - Default` or the update template, `Consent mode - Update ad storage settings`.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Review Cookiebot documentation to make sure everything is set up correctly.\n\n7.  **Conversion Linker:**\n\n    *   **Recommendation:** Enable cross-domain linking (if applicable). In `Conversion Linker`, enabling cross-domain linking ensures that Google Ads and Analytics can accurately track user journeys across different domains.\n\n8.  **Deprecated Universal Analytics Tags:**\n\n    *   **Problem:** The Universal Analytics tags, specifically Tag ID 50 and 155, are associated with legacy tracking methods and do not fully support modern data privacy standards.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Migrate all tracking to GA4. If this has been done and the UA tags are no longer needed, delete them.\n\n9.  **Enhanced Conversions:**\n\n    *   **Problem:** The Google Ads conversion tag (Tag ID 65) is set up with enhanced conversions, but enhanced conversion relies heavily on PII data (email, phone number, address), so it's important to make sure this data is being collected and transmitted in a privacy-compliant way.  Review the \"Gads - user-provided data\" variable.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Use enhanced conversions for leads, and make sure dataLayer is collecting and mapping the fields\n\n10. **Google Ads Remarketing Tags**\n\n    *   **Problem:** There are three similar Google Ads remarketing tags for View Item, Add To Cart, and Checkout.\n    *   **Recommendation:**  Consider using a single \"all events\" tag with conditional triggers to fire based on the specific event. This can simplify management and potentially improve efficiency.\n\n11. **Awin and Partnerize Redundancy:**\n\n    *   **Problem:** The presence of both Partnerize and Awin tags suggests the website might be running campaigns on both platforms.\n\n    *   **Recommendation:** Make sure these platforms have a good deduplication process.\n\n12. **AWIN and Partnerize blocking triggers conflict**\n    *Problem:* Both AWIN and Partnerize seem to be configured to use an affiliate blocking trigger\n    *Recommendation:* Investigate and remediate potential trigger conflicts\n\n13.  **General Tag Settings:**\n\n    *   **Problem:** Many UA tags appear to be firing \"ONCE\\_PER\\_EVENT\" yet do not have corresponding custom-event triggers.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Check and align naming conventions for data layer events.\n        *   Investigate and fix misconfigurations for these tags.\n\n14.  **Google Tag Parameters (google\\_tag\\_params variable):**\n\n    *   **Recommendation:** Review the data being pushed into `google_tag_params`. This data is used by Google Ads remarketing tags, so ensure that it's accurate, complete, and adheres to Google's policies.\n\n15.  **Data Layer Variables:**\n\n    *   **Recommendation:** Many data layer variables are referencing the \"ecommerce\" object directly (e.g., \"ee transaction id\", \"ee transaction revenue\"). Consider migrating to the GA4-compatible `items` array and standard event parameters. Standardizing these data layer values will improve the long-term maintainability of the container.\n\n16.  **Multiple GA4 destinations**\n\n    *   **Problem:** The GTM setup sends data to two separate GA4 properties, `G-KNVZNWHMGQ` and `G-D2L00EF1V4`\n    *   **Recommendation:** It may be advantageous for the organization to only use a single GA4, and if separate are needed, be sure that your setup has been tested and verified to ensure accuracy.\n\n17.  **Testing**:\n\n    *   **Recommendation**: Because there are a large amount of paused, and test tags and triggers, it's important to have a solid testing plan to avoid any errors on production.\n\n**Specific Tag Recommendations**\n\n*   **Tag 64 (Bing UET - Conversions):** Consider if using the official Bing UET tag instead is suitable. Also, the same All Pages script is being injected here, which is not ideal. You're also passing transaction revenue, but then pushing the pageLoad event again.\n*   **Tag 70 (Facebook Pixel):**  Make sure the \"agent\" parameter is still necessary or relevant.\n*   **Tags 92, 96, 116, 122, 108, 109, 286, 287:** These tags are related to consent and Cookiebot. Review the entire setup to ensure consent mode, Cookiebot, and cookie setting are all configured properly and without conflicts.\n*   **Tags 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 282, 283:** Server-side tags may be sending a separate set of events with PII data. Ensure to configure properly.\n*   **Tag 273 (FB.Purchase):**  Consider using the more robust FB Pixel tag type.\n*   **Tag 296 (Google Ads - Offline Conversions):** These should not be run client side. These are designed to send offline information directly to Google.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Consent Setup:**  Consolidate and validate the consent management process.\n2.  **Migrate from UA to GA4:** Finalize the GA4 setup and remove UA-related tags and variables.\n3.  **Review and Optimize Tags:** Go through each tag and trigger, asking:\n    *   Is it still needed?\n    *   Is it firing correctly?\n    *   Is it using the correct data?\n    *   Can the setup be simplified?\n4.  **Cleanup:** Remove paused or unused tags and variables.\n5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test all changes in a staging environment *before* deploying to production.\n6.  **Document:**  Maintain clear documentation of tag purposes, trigger logic, and variable definitions.\n\nThis analysis provides a starting point for improving your GTM container.  A thorough review and testing process are essential to ensure accurate data collection and compliance with privacy regulations. Remember to consult with your legal and marketing teams throughout this process.\n",
